# Dependencies: Ensure sure that the py-postgresql, and PrettyTable modules are installed, the dbConfig dictionary in the 
# databaseConfig.py file is updated with the credentials needed to connect to your database. A sql file to create the sales table
# is also needed to run this program. This file must be named 'sdap.sql' and contain rows for the sales table as described in the
# project document.

# Starting the Program: Type 'python main.py' and the program will begin executing.

# Running the Program: When the program is run, the terminal will prompt the user to input a file name or the phi operator variables
# inline. The input will then be processed and will generate an algorithm corresponding to the type of query specified by the
# user input.

# Output: The program will output to a file called 'algorithm.py', which can be run without input to return a table of the output
# for the query. The program will also add all rows from 'sdap.sql' into your database into the 'sales' table.
